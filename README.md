 I create this code with reference to Yusuke Sugomori(https://github.com/yusugomori), and  
his book(https://www.amazon.co.jp/Java-Learning-Essentials-Yusuke-Sugomori-ebook/dp/B01956B5RQ).  
I'm very grateful to him.  

・　This algorithm uses many syntax of "for" in one process, and the index of syntax "for" is very import.  
　So I wanted to make the index meaningful, but for that partial width became long.

・I have not yet experimented whether errors propagate.(2016/11/23)
 
・Although details about code are not described at present, I'll add to this place.
